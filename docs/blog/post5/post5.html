        <h1>Guardian of the Redeemer (Redemptoris Custos)</h1>
        <h2 id="summary-">Summary:</h2>
        <p>This encyclical is basically a document that goes over St. Joseph&#39;s role in salvation history and how he
            is an ideal model for us and the Church which Christ has established. We see how St. Joseph stands as a
            silent but just figure in the course of history. Additionally, we see that his role as a father is crucial
            to the person of Jesus as we see that many of the prophecies are fulfilled through St. Joseph&#39;s
            juridical role of fatherhood over Jesus. We get many Bible references throughout the document. Many of them
            are in reference to Luke 1 and Matthew 1 which give us the introductions to the Gospels. </p>
        <h2 id="detailed-notes-">Detailed Notes:</h2>
        <p>The encyclical is split up into the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Gospel Portrait<ul>
                    <li>We see that St. Joseph has a pivotal role in answering the call of God and taking Mary, Mother
                        of God into his house to be his wife through the sacrament of marriage. This act of obedience
                        demonstrates a form of St. Joseph&#39;s own kind of Annunciation and fiat. This parallel is
                        demonstrated between Mary, Mother of God in Luke 1 and St. Joseph in Matthew 1. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The Guardian of the Mystery of God<ul>
                    <li>St. Joseph brings so much to Jesus by acting as his father during the hidden years of Jesus
                        until we see Him in the Presentation at the Temple. We see that Jesus is able to complete much
                        of the prophecies that are ordained through St. Joseph&#39;s juridical fatherhood to Jesus.
                        Additionally, we see that God trusts Mary, Mother of God to the care of St. Joseph that he may
                        guide and support the Holy Family even before the flight to Egypt. We see that St. Joseph is
                        tasked with giving the Jesus his name while he still sat in the womb and registering it in the
                        first census under Caesar Augustus. Next, Joseph handles the circumcision of his son who being
                        born in the Jewish people is to fulfill all rites including circumcision. Jesus is given his
                        name by St. Joseph and we then skip many years to the Presentation at the Temple. Lastly, we see
                        that St. Joseph is called to protect the Holy Family by King Herod who tries to snuff out the
                        Jesus by killing all the first-born children of Bethlehem. Finally, we see the scene where Jesus
                        stays at the temple which is quickly followed by a line about how Jesus was obedient to St.
                        Joseph meaning he was to take up his father&#39;s trade and become a carpenter. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A Just Man, A Husband<ul>
                    <li>We see that Joseph remained faithful to God&#39;s call until the end and this parallels the
                        Annunciation of Mary where we see her fiat. We see that St. Joseph maintains many of the
                        qualities that a just man would have such as the image of a husband and a wife in the beginnings
                        of the Gospels. We see that according to Jewish Law that the marriage takes place in two phases
                        where first the marriage is established and then the wife is brought into the house after the
                        husband builds it. We see that St. Joseph was already married to Mary, Mother of God before she
                        had the baby Jesus. St. Joseph in being a just man decided to quietly divorce her based on the
                        Jewish Law which says that he should divorce her if she is an adulterer. The Father intervenes
                        by sending an angel to tell St. Joseph not to fear to take Mary, Mother of God into his home. We
                        are asked to contemplate on who St. Joseph was when he followed the call of God and gave his
                        entire life to the Blessed mother Mary, Mother of God and her baby Jesus. There are two loves
                        which are the marital and virginal love which St. Joseph and Mary, Mother of God celebrate. They
                        experience all the aspects of a sacramental marriage by freely and intentionally entering into
                        marriage with the fruit of the child Jesus through he was born of The Father. <ul>
                            <li>One quote I really liked was:
                                This bond of charity was the core of the Holy Family&#39;s life, first in the poverty of
                                Bethlehem, then in their exile in Egypt, and later in the house of Nazareth. The Church
                                deeply venerates this Family, and proposes it as the model of all families. Inserted
                                directly in the mystery of the Incarnation, the Family of Nazareth has its own special
                                mystery. And in this mystery, as in the Incarnation, one finds a true fatherhood: the
                                human form of the family of the Son of God, a true human family, formed by the divine
                                mystery. In this family, Joseph is the father: his fatherhood is not one that derives
                                from begetting offspring; but neither is it an &quot;apparent&quot; or merely
                                &quot;substitute&quot; fatherhood. Rather, it is one that fully shares in authentic
                                human fatherhood and the mission of a father in the family. This is a consequence of the
                                hypostatic union: humanity taken up into the unity of the Divine Person of the Word-Son,
                                Jesus Christ. Together with human nature, all that is human, and especially the family -
                                as the first dimension of man&#39;s existence in the world - is also taken up in Christ.
                                Within this context, Joseph&#39;s human fatherhood was also &quot;taken up&quot; in the
                                mystery of Christ&#39;s Incarnation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Work as an Expression of Love<ul>
                    <li>I really liked how much St. Joseph is an example of true work and by his example and through the
                        Crucifixion we have the sanctification of daily work. I particularly like this quote from Paul
                        VI in Discourse (March 19, 1969): Insegnamenti, VII (1969), p. 1268.:<ul>
                            <li>&quot;St. Joseph is the model of those humble ones that Christianity raises up to great
                                destinies;...he is the proof that in order to be a good and genuine follower of Christ,
                                there is no need of great things-it is enough to have the common, simple and human
                                virtues, but they need to be true and authentic.&quot;(36)&quot;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The Primacy of the Interior Life<ul>
                    <li>We are able to see St. Joseph&#39;s humility through the silence about him in the Gospels.
                        Obviously, we know some crucial things about him but the fact that a man gifted with such an
                        honor is left to a couple verses shows that he was focused on playing his part in the biblical
                        story. Jesus spend more time with his father St. Joseph than with the apostles though we hear a
                        lot more of them. Much of who Jesus is also comes from his amazing earthly father St. Joseph.
                        There were two quotes that I really like from this section:<ul>
                            <li>Why should the &quot;fatherly&quot; love of Joseph not have had an influence upon the
                                &quot;filial&quot; love of Jesus? And vice versa why should the &quot;filial&quot; love
                                of Jesus not have had an influence upon the &quot;fatherly&quot; love of Joseph, thus
                                leading to a further deepening of their unique relationship? Those souls most sensitive
                                to the impulses of divine love have rightly seen in Joseph a brilliant example of the
                                interior life.</li>
                            <li>Furthermore, in Joseph, the apparent tension between the active and the contemplative
                                life finds an ideal harmony that is only possible for those who possess the perfection
                                of charity. Following St. Augustine&#39;s well-known distinction between the love of the
                                truth (caritas veritatis) and the practical demands of love (necessitas caritatis),(41)
                                we can say that Joseph experienced both love of the truth-that pure contemplative love
                                of the divine Truth which radiated from the humanity of Christ-and the demands of
                                love-that equally pure and selfless love required for his vocation to safeguard and
                                develop the humanity of Jesus, which was inseparably linked to his divinity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Patron of the Church in Our Day <ul>
                    <li>Lastly we are reminded of how St. Joseph protected the Holy Family from King Herod by fleeing to
                        Egypt upon command by an angel. He faithfully fulfills the demands of God in swiftness and
                        Charity which is further exchanged later on between the father and son. St. Joseph has a similar
                        role in protecting the Church who is first found in Mary, Mother of God. This call was asked for
                        in a previous encyclical by Pope Leo XIII in On Devotion to St. Joseph (Quamquam pluries). This
                        sections ends with a call to ask for the intercession of St. Joseph for the guidance and
                        protection of the Church similar to what he did for the Holy Family. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
