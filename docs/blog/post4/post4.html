        <h1>Holy Spirit Talk</h1>
        <p>Thank you to the Awakening team for selecting me for this topic. This talk is not about abstract ideas and
            dogmas. I am here to speak to you about how the Holy Spirit gives us new sight. The Holy Spirit powers the
            spiritual life and it’s a little difficult to see at first; however, with proper care, I believe the Love of
            God and the Holy Spirit are truly visible to us.</p>

        <br>First let us pray. The response is: Have mercy on us.</br>

        <h3>Opening Prayer:</h3>
        <p>(Repeat after each invocation: Have mercy on us)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spirit of all the forms of grace. R</li>
            <li>Spirit who scrutinizes the divine depths. R</li>
            <li>Spirit who prays for us with inexpressible pleading. R</li>
            <li>Spirit of adoption of the sons of God. R</li>
            <li>Spirit who appeared over the Disciples in the form of tongues of fire. R</li>
            <li>Spirit with which the Apostles were filled. R</li>
            <li>Spirit who gives to each one according to His will. R</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Christianity is quite a strange religion if you think about it in our modern context. We, Christians, talk
            about the Holy Spirit and God&rsquo;s invisible hand a lot, but it feels like we&rsquo;re using words that
            have no meaning. I opened this with the idea that this talk is not about abstract ideas. Rather, it is about
            the power which drives the Body of Christ. For example, why should I believe in the Holy Spirit? Can anyone
            explain to me what a spirit is? I&rsquo;ll give you a moment to consider [pause of a couple seconds]. What
            is a spirit?</p>

        <p>Imagine telling your classmates that their life is guided and influenced by spirits and they should listen to
            the good ones. Better yet, there&rsquo;s an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good spirit hiding inside you and
            every other person who undergoes this water ritual called Baptism, but if I cut you up like a corpse
            there&rsquo;s nothing to show for it. Believe me, your classmates will write you off as some religious nut
            and the nice ones will try to ask a question or two before they silently resign and keep school strictly
            professional. Nice, isn&rsquo;t it? The thing you believe in sounds like something that a crazy person would
            say before family and friends check them into a psych ward. I say this to draw out how radical our belief is
            and expose the world-turning reality of our faith. We are distant from the strangeness of this reality that
            we believe partly because we have words that separate us from how striking these beliefs are.</p>

        <p>Speaking for myself, I knew the Holy Spirit was real when I went through RCIA, but it didn&rsquo;t feel real
            until I got baptized this past Easter. If you ask people what they think a spirit is, many would say an
            invisible force or maybe someone checks the dictionary and says that it's an immaterial entity or the third
            person of the Trinity. In fact, this summer I was speaking with a couple of psychics at a coffee shop and
            the question of what a spirit is naturally came up. I distinctly remember one of the psychics describing
            spirits as being like &ldquo;angsty teenagers&rdquo;. Those answers gesture towards what we believe, but
            what does it mean for our world to have a Holy Spirit, in a Catholic sense? The dictionary definition of
            Spirit will not do justice to this question, which is about the personal nature of the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <p>I want to bring to life the power of the Holy Spirit which is exemplified by Pentecost in the beginning of
            Acts: &ldquo;When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly a sound
            came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And
            there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributed and resting on each one of them. And they were all
            filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.&rdquo;
            I&rsquo;ve spoken with Christians of all types and one of my grave fears is that we lose a sense of the
            mystical and the divine. I want to avoid having a faith that is all material and just empty words to the
            divine. We need to have sight to see the Love of God.</p>

        <p>The Holy Spirit is the most mysterious part of the Holy Trinity. There&rsquo;s a couple of questions that
            come to my mind such as &ldquo;What is the Holy Spirit?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;How do I know what He looks like
            in my life?&rdquo; These are important questions because they force us to dig deeper into our faith. I can
            say for myself that the Holy Spirit was quite mysterious when I was discerning the faith. For context, I
            just got baptized and confirmed this past Easter after growing up in a religion foreign to Christianity.
            It&rsquo;s interesting how the Holy Spirit has changed my life because it seems a little unbelievable that
            this invisible thing, crazier yet, a Person has had such an influence on my life. It must be a person
            because it&rsquo;s impossible to state all the ways that I have been affected by the Holy Spirit. For
            myself, I can&rsquo;t even begin to begin with the ways that my friends have impacted my life from hanging
            out to helping me in times of need, be it for a test or in hard times. The small, unspoken actions are the
            things that really have an impact on our life and you can&rsquo;t tell now until a long time has passed when
            you begin to notice just how beautiful those actions are.</p>

        <p>For example, I noticed in college that when my parents were making food, they would always feed me first
            before feeding themselves. This really struck me because it was never announced and it&rsquo;s taken 22
            years for me to notice it. That&rsquo;s quite a long time to notice, but that kind of love is silent and
            gentle. It feels natural and more importantly, it is not a burden. Rather, we take joy in loving. My
            parents' joy in feeding me first isn&rsquo;t visible in the moments when I&rsquo;m hungry or setting up
            dinner. However, over time I see the world differently now and I&rsquo;ve seen a glimpse of that deep love
            my parents have for me.</p>

        <p>Another example is when you fall in love with another person. I know that many of you are underclassmen and
            having been one I know that relationships and getting into them is often on your mind.. Often we love the
            idea of a relationship because we want to hang out or talk or have an anchor or even the physical touch that
            just feels comforting. Eventually, all of you will fall in love with someone. What&rsquo;s interesting is
            that their appearance changes, but it&rsquo;s not like that person is physically different. They
            didn&rsquo;t do anything special, but that person just seems to sparkle. Nothing material has changed, but
            the world seems a little different and it&rsquo;s so difficult to convey because others can see the same
            thing and glance over. This invisible reality has moved me, though I didn&rsquo;t realize it till I was
            older and had more sight to see it. The Holy Spirit loves us in the same way so that we are changed even
            though the physical world is the same. The Holy Spirit wants to have all YOU and all of YOU!</p>

        <p>I felt this amazing power of sight again when I was baptized. I would read Scripture and it would just shine
            in a way that it never had before. There is just this quality to Scripture that makes it so powerful and
            personal. I can&rsquo;t explain it, but all I know is I seem to marvel everytime I read it. The point that
            I&rsquo;m trying to emphasize is that love changes our sight and God does this acting through the Holy
            Spirit. Our sight is so strange, because we see all the time; however, when we love truly and deeply our
            vision changes. The world is both the same and different, same as before and completely new and different.
        </p>

        <p>The Holy Spirit is Love Personified. I know that sounds like flowery speech, but it&rsquo;s true. More
            importantly, it can change your life should you simply choose to listen to that voice. So far I&rsquo;ve
            spoken about who the Holy Spirit is from my perspective and how I&rsquo;ve grown in understanding. Now, I
            want to approach it from a narrative perspective because I think that&rsquo;ll challenge each of you more
            and we need to look at the reality of our belief straight in the face, otherwise we&rsquo;ll be found
            lacking.</p>

        <p>In a novel by a famous writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky, called Crime and Punishment, one of the main characters is
            Sonya. For context, Sonya is an innocent and anxious girl who offers her body up for prostitution to feed
            her family because her father lost her job and she has many step-siblings who starve. Another character
            offers her family money to survive, but the shame and the scars are still there after the prostitution ends.
        </p>

        <p>Sonya is utterly rejected by the world, a world full of normal, ordinary people like you and me. She sells
            herself to buy food for her starving step-siblings while her father&rsquo;s inability and despair leads to
            alcoholism and disputes in the family. Her father ends up spending all the family&rsquo;s money and there is
            resentment amongst everyone. [pause for a couple of seconds] That&rsquo;s a lot, but the point is that
            Sonya&rsquo;s world is in chaos and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any hope for this poor woman.</p>

        <p>Living through such trials, Sonya still loves her father though he is wasted by addiction and sin. This is a
            difficult task because there is so much that is wrong with him. I remember reading it the first time and
            thinking he doesn&rsquo;t deserve any pity. He&rsquo;s a drunkard. How is it possible that she loves her
            father though he is riddled with flaws? This is a love that exceeds the power of this world. Yet, she offers
            herself up for her step-siblings so they may grow and she may diminish. This kind of love is beyond common
            sense. This kind of love is beyond the wisdom of the educated and well-to-do. She could leave the family
            behind and focus on herself, but she doesn&rsquo;t. It would be so easy for her to walk away! The conviction
            and power that she experiences is not some magic trick or simply because she has more discipline than
            others. There is some extraordinary factor in this story that is not so obvious to our sight. As I mentioned
            at the beginning, we have to dig a little deeper to see what&rsquo;s really happening in Sonya&rsquo;s life.
        </p>

        <p>Sonya is similar to the Biblical Mary Magdalene in a lot of ways; a woman of utter disdain to the world, but
            beautiful to Christ who heals her and lifts her by and through the Holy Spirit. Mary Magdalene is an outcast
            who we see weeping upon the feet of Christ, she is then lifted and made to spread the word of the
            resurrection of our Lord, Jesus Christ. What an honor, she plays such an important role in the story of
            salvation. We get to see through this story how a broken world is overturned by the power of the Holy Spirit
            and the Love of Christ. This story spins upon the redemptive power of the Holy Spirit which has real
            implications for the real world.</p>

        <p>Sonya is given the power of the Holy Spirit! She experiences freedom that many people in easier situations
            lack. She serves as the cross upon which the narrative spins because the Holy Spirit operates through her
            and changes the hearts of many in the story. It&rsquo;s easy to say that she should&rsquo;ve done this or
            that, but we live in a fallen world and tragedies happen. How does she have the strength to support her
            dysfunctional family when common sense fails?</p>

        <p>Well, Sonya reads the Bible in secret with her friend. Surely there must be more to the story than a woman
            who is simply strong enough to support and love her family in tough times. That&rsquo;s just not how our
            lives work. How does Sonya have the strength to believe when she knows what she did is wrong? Wouldn&rsquo;t
            it be easier to fall away from the faith or better yet, what if the words in the Bible are just words? All
            these questions pop up unless she (or we) has someThing that she (or we) can draw strength from! It
            can&rsquo;t just be a thing though, because things have limitations and what if we get tired. So, It must be
            someOne! Maybe she can manipulate the words to say that prostitution is permissible and she did something
            right. Similarly, we could manipulate our thoughts into thinking we sinned for a just cause. But how long
            can that last before we realize that it doesn't work? SomeOne has to be able to bring Sonya and us back to
            the Truth. How does she deal with the constant feeling of impurity or how do we feel after we consistently
            sin? We need SomeONE to make us feel meaningful. She obviously wouldn&rsquo;t believe it on her own because
            the physical world doesn&rsquo;t say so. SomeONE needs to be higher and more true than the world otherwise
            we just wouldn&rsquo;t be convinced to turn from our sinful ways.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of material in this talk, so here are a couple of points that I hope you remember if
            nothing else sticks.</p>

        <p>The first point is I want you to see how the Holy Spirit changes our perception of the world and just how
            visible He is in the story of our lives. The Holy Spirit is not just a definition or an idea to remember.
        </p>

        <p>The second point is that it&rsquo;s not in the moment to moment that we see the hand of God. Rather, it is in
            the weeks, months, years, and totality of our life that we see how God plays a role in making us integral
            parts of His story. I was able to see how subtle love can be in my own parents who made sure I ate before
            they did. This subtle love changed my own vision of the world.</p>

        <p>Lastly, I want us to reflect on how the Holy Spirit powers our own lives in doing the impossible. Like Sonya,
            despite struggling against impossible odds, we are able to love in an incomprehensible way. The Holy Spirit
            is not just an invisible truth, but a visible reality. We can love in impossible ways because the Holy
            Spirit does so already for us!</p>

        <p>I think it would be good to close in prayer.</p>
        <h3>Closing Prayer</h3>
