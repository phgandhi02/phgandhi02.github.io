    <p>Hi there, my name is Prem Gandhi. Thanks for showing up to my website.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in the following topics:</p>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Controls</li>
    <li>Dynamical Systems</li>
    <li>Signal Processing</li>
    <h3>Desciption of Me:</h3>
    <p>I am currently a student in Industrial and Systems Engineering with 
      a background in statistical analytics, dynamical systems modeling,
      and robotics. I have build multiple robots and worked with various platforms for 
      robots such as Raspberry Pi's, Nvidia Jetson Nanos, and Arduinos. Additionally,
      I am proficient in simulating robot behavior and controls through popular simulation
      tools like ROS, Gazebo, and Unity. I have also worked with popular computer-vision
      packages like OpenCV and will be working with tools like YoloV8.
