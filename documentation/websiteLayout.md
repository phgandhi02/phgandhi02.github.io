# Website Layout

The website will take the following layout.
The website will feature a sidebar menu or a topside menu that will have a animation that
shows the porfolio, pictures, blog (with subsequent blog options), and any other options. 

I need to decide on the color and theme. I should pic something that is unique to me or 
maybe have the website be a panorama of my different tastes and interests. It could be a 
look into my mind a little bit. I'll have to keep thinking about it.
