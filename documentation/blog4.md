# Website Dev Blog

### 11/29/24

I've been updating my blog with lots of posts and hopefully I can start to really build it up into something interesting. So far I have about 4 posts and I believe there's a good rhythm going now. I have a template html page now and I've been changing up the site with a lot of different things. Now I have to work on my interests page and make that one look good. I'm hoping to structure the page a lot nicer as I mentioned in my last post. I also need to update the README.
