I've started to go back and fix up my website in preparation for graduate school. There's a bunch of exciting changes that I've been able to make and the website is really starting to look pretty good. It's very clean and professional. I need to spend some more time and really add some material and then it should come together fairly fast. I'm planning to flesh out and add some pictures and details under the portfolio section. I've got a basic outline that I've had since the beginning of the semester but I need to add some details that I can pull from my CV. I'm also hoping that I may be able to start writing some stuff about the faith and then maybe I could throw a couple dollars once the material starts to look pretty good. I should put my Holy Spirit talk on there since I spent a lot of time writing it.
