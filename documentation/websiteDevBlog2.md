# Website Dev Blog 2

I have been pretty lax on the website since I was busy working using Isaac Sim which took a lot of time. I have managed to crack that and I'm working at a dealership now. I am looking into various tools for designing websites. I was looking into how to use CSS style sheets and I think I've figured out the basics.

There's also some websites that I found that implement a tool called webflow which leads to some pretty interesting websites. THe idea is to use JS for creating the website logic and behavior which can lead to interactive websites where people can make, say their portfolio, a game. I'll link some websites below but the idea is very interesting to me for crafting a portfolio which is more personal than say a business website which should be professional and easy to use.

### Interesting websites:
- [Chiara Luzzana — Sound Designer](https://www.chiaraluzzana.com/)
- [Pierre-Louis | Creative freelancer (pierrelouislabonne.fr)](https://pierrelouislabonne.fr/)
- [Wayside Studio](https://www.wayside.studio/)
- [Peter Oravec](https://peteroravec.com/)
- [Recap After Use](https://www.recapafteruse.co.uk/)
- [Nomadic Tribe — makemepulse](https://2019.makemepulse.com/)

[jtorre39.github.io](): An interactive website portfolio meant to capture the essence of witty games while retaining its function as a web portfolio.

[3D_portfolio]: Let's build a cool 3D website together! You'll learn how to make a portfolio with fun interactive parts, like a floating island and a fox that moves when you type. It'll allow you to show off your skills and get a job! (github.com)

### Tools to Look into:
- [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)

### CSS example
It basically interacts with the various objects in an html file and then applies attribute settings based on depth. High level adjusts can be overwritten by low-level property attributes so if you make the main theme yellow for all words and then say one specific section have blue words then all words not explicitly stated otherwise will be yellow. The words you specified to be blue will be blue.
