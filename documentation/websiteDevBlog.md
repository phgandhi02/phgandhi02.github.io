# Website Dev Blog

### 8/22/24

I'm starting this blog to document the creative process of making my website so that it reflects my interests and personality in a way that is unique to me. I want the website to ultimately be something that I could point to and say that it includes a part of me that you can see if you know me. This would make viewing the website a real treat for the people that I really care about ie. the people around me  that I know and love. It would also be cool because I could include inside jokes and easter eggs so that it would reflect different relationships that I have and be a bit more organic than the Obsidian which is just a thought map. This one is creative because it involves design and care which makes it more special than a brain dump. 

I'll need to look into things that I can utilize to give me the kind of look that I want but I imagine that I'll need to use css, html, and JS to make it happen. I'll maybe need to talk to Cynthia to figure out the style but in the meantime, I can brainstorm. Something cool that I just thought of by the way is that this could bring some  levity to the PhD students that I know. I've gotten to know a lot of cool ones that could use the humor.
