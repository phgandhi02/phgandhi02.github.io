# Prem Gandhi's Personal Homepage
This is my personal webpage. 
 
# Blog
I want to host two blogs; one where I can talk about science, and another where I can talk about the Catholic faith. These are two very important parts of my life and I want to demonstrate to the world that they are compatible and enriching through beautiful prose. I love philosophy and this would give me the opportunity to meld philosophy into both of those areas and find some interesting cross-sections between the two.

## Robotics
- Ball-Bot: This was my senior design project. 
- SCARA robot: Developed this for ISE 589.
- personal: sim of drones flying
- tbd - personal: physics engine for learning dynamics and controls
- AML-CAML Research: I am developing a digital twin that will be used to model a manipulator, specfically a UR10/UR5, to grab teeth molds which have been 3D printed. There are various teeth molds on a single print which must be removed by applying leverage in a hole which is used to lift and grab the teeth with the manipulator end-effector. The digital twin will be programmed to lift teeth off the conveyor in the sim which will imitate the real world scenario. The sim should be able to write and read from the manipulator joint states along with generating synthetic data from the sim. This way the real world scenario and the simulation can be compared to each other. Abberations between the sim and the real-world scenario can imply a disturbance or potential failure because our simulated model is different from the real-world that it is modeling. 
- Nematode Project - This project is designed to detect, classify, and segment various nematode species to determine where nematodes are in a microscopic picture and whether they are good or bad. This can be applied directly in nematode research where counting, detection, and classification of nematodes and their species are important. It has applications for understanding the movement of nematodes, mating behavior, impact on agriculture.
- tbd - research for Horn
- tbd - spherical motor with Neural Nets for control
