# Prem Gandhi's Personal Homepage
This is my personal webpage.
 
# Blog
I want to host two blogs; one where I can talk about science, and another where I can talk about the Catholic faith. These are two very important parts of my life and I want to demonstrate to the world that they are compatible and enriching through beautiful prose. I love philosophy and this would give me the opportunity to meld philosophy into both of those areas and find some interesting cross-sections between the two.
